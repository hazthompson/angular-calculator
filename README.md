# BcchAngularExercise

## Exercise Instructions:

- To initiate the exercise, fork this repository as private, and invite <nigel.stewart@bcchdigital.ca>, <juan.tellez@bcchdigital.ca>, and <rachel.teo@bcchdigital.ca> with read-only access. Starting with this bootstrapped Angular project, provide a solution to the project requirements stated below.

- Project dependencies can be installed via `npm install` within project root.

```javascript
/**
 * Note: You will need to have the latest stable version of NPM installed, along with the Angular CLI.
 * Instructions can be found here: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart
 */
```

- The exercise has a max time limit of 3 hours.

- To complete the exercise, commit your code and modify the README.md with 'Test finished'.

## Requirements:

- Build a calculator with textarea display and buttons for the numbers/operators. It must be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two single-digit integers.

- Must display answers up to 6 decimals.

- Must use Bootstrap's CSS (CDN) for the application interface.

- Must have 4 unit test cases to cover each operator of the application, using 'ng test'.

- Must have 4 e2e test cases to cover each operator of the application, using 'ng e2e'.

## Bonus points:

- Add listeners to the number buttons so that they can be triggered by their keystrokes.
